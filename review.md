## Suggestions

On the last line of your class, instead of repeating self.position, you could type [self.position]*4. Would you maybe even be able to just say self.position = [mold]*4 ?

It looks like you tried formatting your docstring, but it makes it kinda strange to read because it doesn't actually format. 

When you get a chance, add in a second helper function so you meet the assignment goals, doesn't seem like you'll have much trouble. 

## Compliments

Your O class is a really good example of a practical use case for classes

Good job on your confusion plot function, seems like you're pretty comfortable leaving colab which is great!
